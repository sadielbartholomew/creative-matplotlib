Ellsworth Kelly (1923-2015)
[was an American artist](https://ellsworthkelly.org/biography/).

This mini-project uses NumPy arrays to reproduce some of his works, notably
after demonstrating the general procedure & code for representation with some
(visually) trivial works (*Nine Squares* & *Spectrum I*), focuses on his
works based on arbitrary ("by chance") arrangement of coloured squares to
form gridded compositions (*Colors for a Large Wall* & some works from the
*Spectrum Colors Arranged by Chance* series).

In the latter case, four generated replications are shown in a grid to
demonstrate the variance in designs created using random sampling. Every
run of the code gives a different variation that adheres to the
general pattern & structure by the configuration parameters applied.
